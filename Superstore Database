# For this project I worked on a Superstore database where I used SQL to retrieve and analyze data. This included querying information on item prices, such as average, maximum, and minimum prices, total number of items purchased, and the sum of prices, with the results grouped by category. 
# Additionally, I queried statistics on stock levels and item ratings.

#1. Order the items by price
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC
;

#2. General statistics
SELECT COUNT(price), SUM(price), ROUND(AVG(price),2) as average_price, MIN(price), MAX(price)
FROM superstore
;

#3. List of categories
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM superstore
;

#4. Statistics about the price for items in "Kitchen Supplies"
SELECT category, COUNT(price), SUM(price), AVG(price), MIN(price), MAX(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies'
;

#5. How many Smart LED TV are in stock?
SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name='Smart LED TV'
;

#6. Which is the item with the highest rating?
SELECT item_name, MAX(average_rating)
FROM superstore
;

#7. What are the items with fewer pieces in stock?
SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE stock_quantity = (SELECT MIN(stock_quantity)
FROM superstore)
;

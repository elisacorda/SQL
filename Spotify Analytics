# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#1. What are the key characteristics of the top 10 most popular tracks?
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity
LIMIT 10
;

#2. Which artists have the most tracks in the database?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) number_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY number_songs DESC
LIMIT 10
;

#3. List the number of tracks grouped by ranges of danceability.
SELECT COUNT(track_name), CASE WHEN danceability>0.9 THEN '0.9+'
WHEN danceability>0.7 THEN '0.7+'
WHEN danceability>0.5 THEN '0.5+'
ELSE 'Under 0.5' END AS danceability_range
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY danceability_range
ORDER BY danceability DESC
;

#4. What is the average duration of tracks grouped by time signature?
SELECT time_signature, ROUND(AVG(duration_ms))
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY time_signature
;

#5. Are there any tracks with high danceability but low popularity?
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability>0.7 AND popularity<70
;

#6. Which key (song_key) is most commonly used in the most energetic tracks?
SELECT song_key, COUNT(*) track_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy>0.8
GROUP BY song_key
ORDER BY song_key DESC
;

#7. What is the average tempo and energy level for tracks in each mode (major or minor)?
SELECT song_mode, AVG(tempo) avg_tempo, AVG(energy) avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_mode
;
